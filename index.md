# Lingua Latina Legenda (L3)

*Lingua Latina Legenda* is a collaborative effort to develop a new approach to teaching Latin aimed at engaging students with authentic unaltered texts as early as possible.   We analyze rigorously curated digital text corpora to design introductory course material following principles and best practices taken from contemporary research in pedagogy and linguistics.


## For students and teachers of Latin

The textbook and accompanying course material draw on the *Fabulae* attributed to Hyginus for reading selections:

- [textbook and reference materials for an introductory course in Latin](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook/), comparable to a first-year course at the college/university level
-  [course material](https://lingualatina.github.io/courses/) you can use in developing courses based on the L3 textbook

## Background material

Material we have used in analyzing the Latin text of Hyginus' *Fabulae*:


- [citable digital corpora](https://lingualatina.github.io/texts/)
- [morphological data sets](https://lingualatina.github.io/morphology/)
- [code libraries, scripts and tools](https://lingualatina.github.io/analysis/) supporting analysis of a corpus to design courses on modern pedagogical principles
